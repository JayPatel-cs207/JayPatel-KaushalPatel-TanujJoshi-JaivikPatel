# Project207 - *Laser Security System(LSS)*--->**README :** This Readme contains the information about the build and use of laser security system.   ---*Laser security system* is a powerful security system which you can build using the Arduino that can be used to protect our offices, banks and museums from stealing the important/precious things.---* Repository contents :	* README.md	*  Code for Laser Security System	* CS 207 Presentation.pptx---####Software Requirement :> To run the code you need to install Arduino UNO, if it is not installed , Click on [Arduino UNO](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) to Download the software.---####Material Requirement : > * 1 * Arduino UNO and Breadboard > * 1 * Blue and Red LED > * 1 * Laser > * 1 * Buzzer > * 1 * Photo Diode> * 1 * Resistors ( ohms)> * 1 * Fingerprint sensor > * 1 * Servo* jumper wires( Male to Male & Male to Female )To see the material and their use visit : [Material and their use.pdf](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17G5DPxp6eqhZEsWOReoNuyra4CyZAZU1GcT1idSKCmE/edit)---####Build Instruction :> Place all the connection properly, check whether the wires are connected to the same pin number as given in the code otherwise you will get errors. >**NOTE:** If you are connecting the Laser light separately then use proper power supply.(5v recommended).Giving power from the Arduino will work.>**Warning :** Do not use external battery to give power to laser light, it might get fused.(we tried and got 2 laser light fused while making this project)  ---####Working Demo :> To see the working demonstration  [CLICK HERE](https://youtu.be/FRWScmtj_hE)---####Team Contribution :1.
